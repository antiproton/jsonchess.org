	<strong>jsonchess</strong> is a protocol for playing chess games over the
	internet. Clients connect to a server to play games against each other by
	exchanging messages. These documents describe what messages each end
	needs to send and listen for, and define some constants to specify how
	they should behave.
</p>
<p>
	The protocol consists of a core, which must be supported by all jsonchess
	servers, and several optional modules. Clients can request details of
	what modules are supported from the server.
