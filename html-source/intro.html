<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>
	The protocol only defines the messages sent back and forth and
	what they mean;
	it doesn't explicitly deal with the context of the messages (the
	state of the client and server applications at time of sending).
	It is left up to the developer to make sure
	their implementation maintains a sensible state and handles messages
	appropriately depending on the circumstances.
</p>
<h2>Message format</h2>
<p>
	The basic format of all messages exchanged on the protocol is a JSON
	object with a <code>topic</code> field and an optional <code>data</code>
	field. The topics look like URL paths:
</p>
<p>
	<code>/game/123/move</code>
</p>
<p>
	The whole message sent by the server when the move e4 is played in the
	game with id "123" looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
	<code>
		{	
			"topic": "/game/123/move",
			"data": {	
				"from": 12,
				"to": 28,
				"index": 0,
				"time": 1407781765400
			}
		}
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	Variable parts of a topic, such as the game id above, are notated in this
	documentation with colon-prefixed identifiers:
</p>
<p>
	<code>"/game/:id/move"</code>
</p>
<h2>
	Data structures
</h2>
<p>
	To avoid repetition, these pages set out some named JSON structures to
	refer to later, using a small set of operators to describe what types and
	ranges of data they can contain.
</p>
<p>
	As well as the names of data structures defined within jsonchess, the following
	keywords are used to refer to primitive JSON types:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>Number</code> - a JSON number</li>
	<li><code>String</code> - a JSON string</li>
	<li><code>Boolean</code> - JSON true or false</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The keyword <code>undefined</code> is used to indicate that an object property
	may not be present at all.  For example, in the ClientMove structure the
	promotion field isn't always required:
</p>
<pre>
	<code>
		{
			"from": Square,
			"to": Square,
			"promoteTo": undefined | PieceType
		}
	</code>
</pre>
<h3>Operators</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		<code>..</code>
		<p>
			Denotes ranges of numbers or letters.  Ranges are always inclusive.
			For example, the following data structure definition accepts a number from 0 to 63
			inclusive:
		</p>
		<p>
			<code>0 .. 63</code>
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<code>|</code> (pipe)
		<p>
			"or".
		</p>
		<p>
			The following data structure definition accepts either "w" or "b":
		</p>
		<p>
			<code>"w" | "b"</code>
		</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Arrays</h3>
<p>
	Arrays are written as a type followed by <code>, ...</code> within square brackets.  The
	following data structure definition accepts an array containing zero or more Strings:
</p>
<p>
	<code>[ String, ... ]</code>
</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
	When describing protocol messages: data structure references, ranges,
	array notation and "undefined" have special meaning as explained above.
	Everything else is plain JSON.  All messages are JSON objects with a
	"topic" property and an optional "data" property, and are described in
	the same way as data structures.
